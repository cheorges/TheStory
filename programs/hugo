Modulus takes Number and Divisor
While Number is as high as Divisor
Put Number without Divisor into Number

Let it be Number

Let Limit be 11
Let Counter be 1
Let Hugo be 0
While Counter is not Limit
Put Modulus taking Counter and 7 into result
If result is 0
Say "Hugo"
Else
Say Counter

Now Counter will be Counter plus 1
